README -- This file
Makefile -- Makefile of the project
emServer.cpp -- The server side program.
emClient.cpp -- The client side program.

REMARKS:


ANSWERS:
Q1:
a. On the client side, in the loop we will add a new function trying to read
incoming messages from the server, and if there are, it will print to the 
client standard output a message about the new event.
b. On the server side, we will need to add the list of client names their
socket fds, and when a "CREATE AND DISTRIBUTE" command comes from some client,
it will pass over all the client's sockets and send to each one a message.

Q2:
We prefer TCP because we want to make sure the messages sent will be delivered
and in the order they were sent. With TCP we can do that, while with UDP there
is no guarantee that this will happen. For example, the client may send
REGISTER and UNREGISTER commands, but the server will get the commands on the
opposite order (UNREGISTER first).

Q3:
a. Online multiplyer games - UDP is better because it is faster, and for online
games we prefer that they will work fast without delays.
b. Videos - UDP is better as we want the video to play smoothly and without
delayes.

Q4:
We will write all the data to a file, and the file will save all the clients
and events currently on the server. Once in a while, we will flush the file.
Then, where is a server failure, we can restore the data from the file, and
maybe just small part of the data that wasnt saved on the file before it was
flushed will be lost.
